Instructions:
For this exercise, you will have to find some requests on your own!

1. Create:
   - Create a database called bootcamp.
   - Create a table called students.
   - Add the following columns:
     - id
     - last_name
     - first_name
     - birth_date
   - The id must be auto_incremented.
   - Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.
   - Here is the data to insert:

   | id | first_name | last_name | birth_date |
   |----|------------|-----------|------------|
   |  1 | Marc       | Benichou  | 02/11/1998 |
   |  2 | Yoan       | Cohen     | 03/12/2010 |
   |  3 | Lea        | Benichou  | 27/07/1987 |

   |  6 | Omer       | Simpson   | 03/10/1980 |

2. Insert:
   - Insert the data seen above into the students table. Find the most efficient way to insert the data.
   - Insert your last_name, first_name, and birth_date into the students table (Take a look at the id given).

3. Select:
   - Fetch all of the data from the table.
   - Fetch all of the students' first_names and last_names.
   - For the following questions, only fetch the first_names and last_names of the students:
     - Fetch the student whose id is equal to 2.
     - Fetch the student whose last_name is Benichou AND first_name is Marc.
     - Fetch the students whose last_names are Benichou OR first_names are Marc.
     - Fetch the students whose first_names contain the letter 'a'.
     - Fetch the students whose first_names start with the letter 'a'.
     - Fetch the students whose first_names end with the letter 'a'.
     - Fetch the students whose second-to-last letter of their first_names is 'a' (Example: Leah).
     - Fetch the students whose idâ€™s are equal to 1 AND 3.
     - Fetch the students whose birth_dates are equal to or come after 1/01/2000 (show all their info).
