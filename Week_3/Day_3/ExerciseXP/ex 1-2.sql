-- 1. Get a list of all the languages from the language table

-- 2. Get a list of all films joined with their languages
SELECT f.title AS film_title, f.description, l.name AS language_name
FROM film f
JOIN language l ON f.language_id = l.language_id;

-- 3. Get all languages, even if there are no films in those languages
SELECT f.title AS film_title, f.description, l.name AS language_name
FROM language l
LEFT JOIN film f ON l.language_id = f.language_id;

-- 4. Create a new table called new_film with columns id and name
CREATE TABLE new_film (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- Add some new films to the new_film table
INSERT INTO new_film (name) VALUES 
('The Matrix'),

üåü Exercise 2: DVD Rental

Instructions:
1. Use UPDATE to change the language of some films. Make sure that you use valid languages.
2. Which foreign keys (references) are defined for the customer table? How does this affect the way in which we INSERT into the customer table?
3. Drop the customer_review table. Is this an easy step, or does it need extra checking?
4. Find out how many rentals are still outstanding (i.e., have not been returned to the store yet).
5. Find the 30 most expensive movies which are outstanding (i.e., have not been returned to the store yet).
6. Help your friend find the movies he wants to rent based on the following clues:
   - The 1st film: The film is about a sumo wrestler, and one of the actors is Penelope Monroe.
   - The 2nd film: A short documentary (less than 1 hour long), rated ‚ÄúR‚Äù.
   - The 3rd film: A film that his friend Matthew Mahan rented. He paid over $4.00 for the rental, and he returned it between the 28th of July and the 1st of August, 2005.
   - The 4th film: A film that his friend Matthew Mahan watched, had the word ‚Äúboat‚Äù in the title or description, and was an expensive DVD to replace.
*/

-- 1. Update the language of some films
UPDATE film 
SET language_id = (SELECT language_id FROM language WHERE name = 'French')
WHERE title IN ('The Matrix', 'Inception');

-- 2. Foreign keys in the customer table
/*
The customer table likely has foreign keys referencing:
- The store table (store_id).
- The address table (address_id).

These foreign keys ensure referential integrity, meaning that when inserting into the customer table, you must provide valid existing store_id and address_id values from the store and address tables respectively.
*/

-- 3. Drop the customer_review table
DROP TABLE customer_review;

-- Dropping a table is a straightforward process, but you need to ensure that the table is not being referenced by other tables (no foreign key dependencies) or it might lead to errors or data integrity issues.

-- 4. Find out how many rentals are still outstanding (not returned)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS outstanding_rentals
FROM rental
WHERE return_date IS NULL;

-- 5. Find the 30 most expensive movies which are outstanding (not returned)
SELECT film.title, film.rental_rate, rental.rental_date
FROM rental
JOIN inventory ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
JOIN film ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
WHERE rental.return_date IS NULL
ORDER BY film.replacement_cost DESC
