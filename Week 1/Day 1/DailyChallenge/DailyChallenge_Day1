#Instructions
#Using the input function, ask the user for a string. The string must be 10 characters long.
#If it’s less than 10 characters, print a message which states “string not long enough”.
#If it’s more than 10 characters, print a message which states “string too long”.
#If it’s 10 characters, print a message which states “perfect string” and continue the exercise.

#Then, print the first and last characters of the given text.

#Using a for loop, construct the string character by character: Print the first character, then the second, then the third, until the full string is printed.
    

    # Get the user input
user_input = input("Please enter a string: ")

# Check the length of the input string
if len(user_input) < 10:
    print("String not long enough")
elif len(user_input) > 10:
    print("String too long")
else:
    print("Perfect string")
    
    # Print the first and last characters
    print("First character:", user_input[0])
    print("Last character:", user_input[-1])
    
    # Construct and print the string character by character
    constructed_string = ""
    for char in user_input:
        constructed_string += char
        print(constructed_string)
